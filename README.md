### Hi there 👋 my name is Nick, I am an AI research engineer specializing in Natural Language Processing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on LLM benchmark Ecosystem
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on applied NLP to industrial projects
- ⚡ You can also check more cool visualizations  of my github projects at my website [www.kapitan.uk](https://www.kapitan.uk/)

Here are some of my notable projects:
1. I implemented from scratch the 🔙backpropagation algorithm and 🤖Transformer architecture for 🔄ENG-GER machine translation.
2. I replicate from scratch 📐GPT-2 architecture, and 🖥️trained it on 8XA100 GPU cluster to achieve the same OpenAI score.
3. I implemented a 🌍Multi-language XML-RoBERTa for 🏷️Named Entity Recognition
4. I implemented the 🐎Pegasus model for 📝Summarization of people's 💬dialogues
5. Given a user's ❓question, I extracted relevant 📂docs and implemented miniML to answer the question
6. I implemented 🎓Knowledge distillation to reduce the 🍃model size while maintaining the same performance
7. I implemented 🤌quantization and ✂️weights pruning to reduce model 💾size and ⌛latency
8. I developed the automatic report for any LLM and any dataset to measure its 📊performance, 💽disk space and ⌛latency
